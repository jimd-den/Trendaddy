/**

 * The model returns pixels and nothing else: it cannot be trusted to report a
 * grid, and asking it to describe its own output in JSON fails far more often
 * than the drawing does. So the grid is *dictated* in the prompt and assumed on
 * the way back, and the returned image is scaled to fit whatever it actually is.
 * That is why a low-quality generation still produces a usable sheet.
