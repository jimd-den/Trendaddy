 * character instead. The sheet is then cut on a grid that was never drawn, so
 * every "frame" is a crop of the same picture and the sprite appears to roll or
 * pan rather than animate. Nothing in the reply says this happened — the image
 * is the right size and decodes fine — so the only way to know is to look at
 * the pixels.
 *
 * The signal is the gutters. A real sheet has near-empty seams between cells
 * and content in the middle of them; one big picture has content straight
 * across every seam. That holds whatever the art style is, which a comparison
 * of frame contents would not.
 *
 * Pure ARGB so it can be tested without a graphics stack.
