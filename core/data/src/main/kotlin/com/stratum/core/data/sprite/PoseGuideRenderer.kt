/**
 * Draws a pose as a stick figure, to be handed to the image model.
 *
 * The argument for doing this at all: prose is a poor way to specify a body.
 * "Right leg forward with the heel touching the ground, left arm swung forward"
 * is unambiguous to a person and merely suggestive to an image model — measured,
 * an attack described that way came back as a cross-body guard. A drawing of
 * the pose is not suggestive.
 *
 * Deliberately crude. A guide that is shaded, coloured or detailed invites the
 * model to reproduce *it* rather than to pose the character by it; flat black
 * lines on white are unmistakably a diagram. Small, too, because it rides
 * alongside a megabyte of character reference and a line drawing needs no
 * resolution to be read.
