# Architecture

Stratum is an isometric voxel action RPG: a block world you mine and build in,
wrapped in an ARPG shell, where the content is data rather than code.

## The module graph

```
                       :app  (Activity, navigation, composition root)
                        │
        ┌───────────────┼───────────────┬──────────────────┐
        │               │               │                  │

Dependencies point inward only. Nothing in `:core:domain` knows that Android,
Room, OkHttp or Compose exist.

## The modules

| Module | Kind | Holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `:core:domain` | Pure Kotlin | The voxel model, content packs, player state, the AI ports and the generation use cases. |
| `:engine:world` | Pure Kotlin | Terrain generation, chunk streaming, mining and building rules, isometric projection, the play session. |
| `:content:igbo` | Pure Kotlin | The built-in content pack. Data only. |
| `:core:data` | Android library | Adapters: the OpenAI-compatible model client and provider settings. |
| `:core:designsystem` | Android library | The visual language, driven entirely by the loaded pack's palette. |
| `:feature:play` | Android library | The isometric renderer and the play screen. |
| `:feature:forge` | Android library | AI pack generation and its preview. |
| `:legacy:domain` | Pure Kotlin | The original engine's rules, pending port. |
| `:legacy:data` | Android library | The original engine's Room and network layer. |
| `:feature:studio` | Android library | The original creator studio screens. |
| `:app` | Android app | The Activity, navigation between destinations, and the wiring that connects ports to adapters. |

## How the boundary is enforced

Not by review. `:core:domain`, `:engine:world`, `:content:igbo` and
`:legacy:domain` apply only the Kotlin JVM plugin, so the Android SDK is not on
their compile classpath and `import android.*` fails to compile.

`./gradlew architectureCheck` closes the loophole around that: it fails the
build if one of those modules picks up an Android plugin or an Android artifact.
It is wired into CI. To see it work, add `implementation(libs.androidx.core.ktx)`
to `core/domain/build.gradle.kts` and run it.

## Why content packs

The engine ships with no content. Blocks, regions, classes, lore and the
interface palette all come from a `ContentPack`, and the three sources — the
built-in module, an AI generation run, and a file a player imported — are
indistinguishable to everything downstream. Packs layer: a later pack overrides
an earlier one by id, so a generated pack can restyle a handful of blocks
without forking the whole thing.

`ContentPackAssembler` flattens the enabled packs into an `AssembledContent`, and
validates that every block a region names actually exists. That is why a
generated pack fails at the generate button rather than mid-world-generation.

## Why generation logic lives in the domain

Prompt construction, JSON extraction, repair and validation are all in
`:core:domain`, behind a one-method `LanguageModelPort`. The network adapter in
`:core:data` only moves bytes.

That split is what makes the hard part testable: the generation tests run a
fake model that returns markdown-fenced JSON, missing namespaces, dangling block
references and out-of-range numbers, and assert the result is still playable —
with no network and no Android.

## Conventions

Module build files stay declarative because `build-logic` carries the shared
configuration: `stratum.jvm`, `stratum.android.library` and
`stratum.android.compose`.

## Running it

```sh
./gradlew test                  # every module's unit tests
./gradlew architectureCheck     # boundary enforcement
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease  # the APK CI attaches to each pull request
```

Screenshot tests render the shell, the play screen and the forge. Re-record them
after an intentional visual change:

```sh
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest -Proborazzi.test.record=true
```
